# Propmpt 1 - Creation of the pipeline

As an expert DEvOps engineer, create a pipeline using github actions to perform the next actions:
1. Move to the backend and run the tests with "npm test" and report the results
2. Build the backend code running "npm run build" and report the results
3. Deploy the react project to an EC2 instance at AWS.

The pipeline code must be generated into the pipeline.yml file
